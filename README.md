Breakout Game

This was a quick implementation of pygame in creating a version of the game breakout.

How it works
  There is a quick display of the title screen with a rendered background image
  There are 2 imported custom fonts for the game
  You press any button to escape the title screen, then choose 1,2 or 3 for the game difficulty, the ball is fast as the difficulty increases
  You move your "paddle" rectangle around trying to keep the ball in the "air" and break the "bricks" at the top of the screen. You have a given 2 lives, so if you
  miss the ball you lose a life until you have none, then the game ends. You win by breaking all of the blocks

  I had previously built my games with tkinter and not pygame, but pygame made it so much easier. I learned about the .colliderect() which was a game changer, a quick
  comparison without any needed math to calcuate if any collisions occured. I also liked working with my Height and Width variables, which made dynamic objects that could change
  based on the given screen size. 
  Importing fonts and a background image was also really run, I have never done this in a pygame like library before
  I also used git bash and the command line to save this work so I am happy that I can work with those commands as well as the lovely github UI

  Overall this was a fun project and yeah! Will continue to make more!
